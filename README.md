# Bad Ducky

## Summary 
Bad Ducky is yet another [Rubber Ducky](https://hakshop.com/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe) clone. It is based on CJMCU BadUsb (ATMEGA32u4 - Arduino Leonardo clone) board with onboard card reader, which you can buy on ebay or [aliexpress](

My goal was to create something compatible with Rubber Ducky scripts, while having ability to easily choose which script to execute without modifying the hardware (without adding DIP switches).

## What is so special about this one?
- it is completely compatible with [Rubber Ducky scripts](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript) (all commands are supported)
- scripts does not require compiling/encoding
- there is no limit on payload size (the only limit is SD card size)
- it has two operational modes (continuous delivery and one-time delivery)
- you can switch between modes/payloads with your smartphone
